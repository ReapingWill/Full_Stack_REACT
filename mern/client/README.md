Components - In React, components are the building blocks of any application. They are reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page. Components can be simple, like a button, or complex, like an entire page. 

Props - are a way to pass data from one component to another, specifically from parent to child components. They are read-only, meaning that a component receiving props cannot modify them. This unidirectional data flow helps maintain consistency and predictability in the application. Props can be of any type, including numbers, strings, objects, arrays, and even functions. They are used to customize components and render dynamic content based on the data passed to them.

State - State is a feature of React components that allows them to have internal data that can change over time.  State is managed within the component itself. State changes can trigger re-renders of the component, allowing it to respond to user input, data changes, and other events.
